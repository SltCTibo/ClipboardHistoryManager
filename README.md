# __ClipboardHistoryManager__
A Clipboard history manager in Rust

## __Requirements__

You need to have cargo & rustup installed on your pc to use this.

[Here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) you can find a tutorial to set up your pc in order to run the project.

## __How to use it__

Clone the repository or download ZIP file.

Go to the clipboard_history_generator directory:
```Bash
cd clipboard_history_generator
cargo build
```
and then you can use it by simply running:
```Bash
cargo run
```

It will open a window where you will be able to see what's actually in your clipboard.
You will also have your clipboard history above what you are currently having inside.

A button is disposed next to each row in the history so that whenever you need something back you can get it back by just clicking the button.
